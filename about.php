                            <P>We believe in establishing clear expectations and that all dogs should know how to; come when called, stay when asked, rest calmly in a crate, and walk nicely on a leash. We also believe in training your dog to be more calm mentally and to make better choices by providing proper outlets for genetic expression and drive satisfaction based on their specific needs. We want dogs to be who they were created to be, but also more pleasant family members! Our training methods build respect and trust by creating a solid foundation utilizing rewards and appropriate corrections, as well as satifying the dog’s needs. With our help, you will be able to be assertive and effectively lead your dog. We work to address the root issues, not just the symptoms.
